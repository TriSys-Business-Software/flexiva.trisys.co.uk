TriSys Business Software has 2 Visual Studio Code extensions for JS and HTML snippets.
Unfortunately, these are available in the Visual Studio Code marketplace, but garry@trisys.co.uk cannot manage them.

The javascript.json file is copied from the current production TriSys Apex Javascript Snippets extension.
This is a good starting point, however since 2017, the Visual Studio Code snippet format is more extensive.

This video is a good starting point for creating a Visual Studio Code snippet extension.

The plan is that once Flexiva has custom forms operational with custom events and functions, 
we will create a new Visual Studio Code extension for Flexiva snippets.

This is not expected to be until 2025.
