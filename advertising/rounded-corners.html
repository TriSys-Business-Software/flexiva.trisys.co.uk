Smooth curved borders are now becoming standard on both desktops, tablets and phones.
TriSys Apex has now followed this trend, adding a pleasing aesthetic to the recruiting experience for consultants.

<strong>As of today, we are pleased to confirm that TriSys Apex now features a smoother user experience
thanks to a comprehensive project which has resulted in the rounding of all user interface components, namely:</strong>
<ul>
<li>All input fields (text, numeric and more)</li>
<li>All dropdown fields (search field selection, conditional clause selection and more)</li>
<li>All pop-up windows (actions, prompts, file upload dialogues and more)</li>
<li>All forms (CV Auto Recognition, Contact, Company, Requirement, Placement, Timesheet)</li>
<li>Individual areas within forms (for example "Personal Details", "Employment Details" and more)</li>
<li>Data grids (lookup fields, pop-up column selectors and more)</li>
<li>Checkboxes on data grids (replaced square checkboxes with circular checkboxes)</li>
<li>Buttons (all buttons in TriSys Apex already had round corners prior to the latest release however we have added further roundness)</li>
</ul>
